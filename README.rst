zz: Plain-text time keeping
===========================

`zz` is a tool to track time for freelance work, in the spirit of the `ledger
<http://plaintextaccounting.org>`_ family.


File format
-----------

`zz` does not record time periods but events, to make synchronization possible.
The central assumption is that on a single timesheet file, only one task can be
active at the same time.
